# einstein
## journey to annus mirabilis

At age 23-29 years old einstein works at Federal office for intellectual property in Bern
for seven years.  
He managed his time exactly: eight hours of work, eight hours of «allotria» (miscellaneous) and scientific work, and eight hours of sleep (which he often used instead for writing his manuscripts). 
In this time he managed to publish a ground breaking paper and lead him to 
one of the best scientist of all the time. 

Insipered by this I make this repository to explore more in the area of computational mathematic modeling
and philoshopical topic of mind.
